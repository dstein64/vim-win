|vim-win| is a Vim plugin for managing windows. Built-in functionality includes
window selection, window buffer swapping, and window resizing. The plugin is
extensible, allowing additional functionality to be added (see
|win-configuration| below).

============================================================================
1. Requirements                            *win-requirements*

* Full functionality
  - `vim>=8.2.4052` or `nvim>=0.7.0`

============================================================================
2. Installation                            *win-installation*

Use |packages| or one of the various package managers.

============================================================================
3. Usage                                   *win-usage*
                                                               *:Win*
Enter |vim-win| with <leader>w or |:Win|.
These can be customized (see |win-configuration| below).

* Arrows or `hjkl` keys are used for movement.
* There are various ways to change the active window.
  - Use movement keys to move to neighboring windows.
  - Enter a window number (where applicable, press <enter> to submit).
  - Use `w` or `W` to sequentially move to the next or previous window.
* Hold <shift> and use movement keys to resize the active window.
  - Left and right movements shift the right border.
  - Down and up movements shift the bottom border.
  - For `vim<8.2.4052` and `nvim<0.7.0`:
    * Left movements decrease width and right movements increase width.
    * Down movements decrease height and up movements increase height.
* Hold <control> and use movement keys to resize the active window.
  - Left and right movements shift the left border.
  - Down and up movements shift the top border.
  - Not available for `vim<8.2.4052` and `nvim<0.7.0`.
* Press `s` or `S` followed by a movement key or window number, to swap buffers.
  - The active window changes with `s` and is retained with `S`.
* Press `?` to show a help message.
* Press <esc> to leave |vim-win| (or go back, where applicable).

============================================================================
4. Configuration                           *win-configuration*

By default, |vim-win| is started with <leader>w or |:Win|. These will not be
clobbered in case they are already used. The |:Win| command takes an optional
argument specifying how many |vim-win| commands to run (e.g., `:Win 1` would
exit |vim-win| after the first command). If the optional argument is `0`, which
is the default, |vim-win| runs until exit.
 >
	" The following defaults can be customized in your .vimrc
	map <leader>w <plug>WinWin
	command Win :call win#Win()

The following variables can be used to customize the behavior of |vim-win|.

`Variable`
  Description                       `Default`
-------------                       -------
*g:win_resize_height*                 `2`
  Number of rows to shift when
  resizing
*g:win_resize_width*                  `2`
  Number of columns to shift when
  resizing
*g:win_disable_version_warning*       |v:false|
  Set to |v:true| to disable the
  version warning
*g:win_ext_command_map*               `{}`
  A dictionary for extending
  |vim-win|

The |g:win_ext_command_map| maps |vim-win| command keys to `vim` command
strings. The *Win#exit* string can be used as a command string for exiting
|vim-win|.

The variables can be customized in your `.vimrc`, as shown in the following
example.
 >
	let g:win_resize_height = 3
	let g:win_resize_width = 4
	let g:win_disable_version_warning = 1
	let g:win_ext_command_map = {
	      \   'c': 'wincmd c',
	      \   'C': 'close!',
	      \   'q': 'quit',
	      \   'Q': 'quit!',
	      \   '!': 'qall!',
	      \   'V': 'wincmd v',
	      \   'S': 'wincmd s',
	      \   'n': 'bnext',
	      \   'N': 'bnext!',
	      \   'p': 'bprevious',
	      \   'P': 'bprevious!',
	      \   "\<c-n>": 'tabnext',
	      \   "\<c-p>": 'tabprevious',
	      \   '=': 'wincmd =',
	      \   't': 'tabnew',
	      \   'x': 'Win#exit'
	      \ }

Color Customization ~
                                           *win-color-customization*
The following highlight groups can be configured to change |vim-win|'s colors.

Name        Default    Description
----        -------    -----------
`WinActive`   `DiffAdd`    Color for the active window label
`WinInactive` `Todo`       Color for inactive window labels
`WinNeighbor` `Todo`       Color for neighbor window labels
`WinStar`     `StatusLine` Color for the command line star (asterisk)
`WinPrompt`   `ModeMsg`    Color for the command line prompt

The highlight groups can be customized in your |.vimrc|, as shown in the
following example.
 >
	" Link WinActive highlight to Error highlight
	highlight link WinActive Error

	" Specify custom highlighting for WinInactive
	highlight WinInactive term=bold ctermfg=12 ctermbg=159 guifg=Blue guibg=LightCyan
